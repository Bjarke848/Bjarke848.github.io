# CogniMate

**CogniMate** is your intelligent, privacy-first companion that harmonizes your **health data**, **calendar**, and **environmental context** to help you live and perform at your best. Whether you're optimizing deep work, recovery, or endurance training, CogniMate connects the dots between your **body, time, and tasks**.

---

## 🧠 Project Vision

CogniMate is built for those who track sleep, workouts, stress, and time—but want the insights to be **actionable**. This system fuses biological rhythms with your daily agenda and external context (e.g. weather, events) into one **adaptive AI agent**.

### Core Goals:
- 🧬 Integrate **biometric health data** (sleep, HRV, activity)
- 📆 Sync and interpret **calendar schedules**
- 🌤️ Add real-world **contextual layers** (weather, location)
- 🤖 Serve as a **personal assistant** that nudges, reschedules, or reflects
